description: <i>Miner Mayhem</i> is a 2v2 platformer where each team must
  coordinate their shared control of a single miner to win a series of high
  stakes races in search of hidden gold! The catch? The only method of movement
  is through the use of deployable grappling hooks! Who will emerge victorious 
  in this battle of teamwork, determination and grit?
