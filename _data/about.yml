    Games are an important art form to me
    Give you agency in a story that others worked to craft. Sometimes large groups, sometimes small
    RDR2, God of War, the Last of Us all gave me the sense that I knew these characters
    I want to work with a team to craft these kinds of experiences. To share with others, but also to share the experience of creating that story in the first place with other people
