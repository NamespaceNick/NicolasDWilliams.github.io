			Who Am I?
		</div>
		I am a Computer Science Engineering student at The University of Michigan, 
		set to graduate May 2020.
		<br /><br />
		I am also the head of <i>WolverineSoft Studio</i>, an initiative I spear-headed
		at the University to facilitate long-term, 15-30 person game projects in the
		hopes of strengthening the game development program and giving students more robust
		experience working with multidisciplinary teams.
		<br /><br />
		The success of the team is my number one passion. Whether it's
		through removing barriers to their work, promoting clear communication, or
		just helping everyone keep track of their tasks, I am most engaged when I 
		feel that I'm making a positive difference in my team's ability to work on
		what is most important.
